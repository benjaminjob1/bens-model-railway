    overview:
      "The Cornish Main Line runs the full length of Cornwall from Plymouth (in Devon) to Penzance at the western tip. It was progressively built from 1859, connecting communities that had previously relied on coastal shipping. The line follows the coastline across the River Tamar via Brunel's famous Royal Albert Bridge, then threads through the heart of Cornwall serving towns that grew up around the railway.",
    history:
      "The line we see today is the product of several railway companies that were gradually merged and standardised. The Cornwall Railway opened the Plymouth–Truro section in 1859, reaching Penzance by 1860. However, the westernmost section from Carn Brea to Angarrack predates even this — it was part of the original Hayle Railway, opened in 1837 to serve the copper mining industry. This makes some of the track bed around Hayle nearly 190 years old.",
